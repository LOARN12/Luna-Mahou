            <h2>Wolfsbane</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meaning:</strong>Wolfsbane is a highly poisonous plant used in potion-making. It's famously
                    used in the Wolfsbane Potion, which allows werewolves to retain their human minds during the full
                    moon. Although the plant is dangerous to handle, skilled potion-makers use it with extreme caution.

                    roots are used in potion-making, its leaves are very toxic. Aconitine, the key toxin in Wolfsbane,
                    can be fatal in small doses, causing a slow heartbeat and potentially leading to death within hours.
                </li>

                    squeezed, it secretes a yellowish-green pus with strong healing powers, particularly for skin

                    cactus covered in boils. When disturbed, it releases a foul-smelling, dark green liquid called
                    Stinksap, its primary defense mechanism. The plant is notable for its connection to Neville
                    Longbottom and its use as a password to Gryffindor Tower.</li>
                <li><strong>Uses:</strong>A defensive plant that immediately squirts when challenged by an external
                    attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong>The Mimbulus Mimbletonia is described as a grey, cactus-like plant with
                    boils where spines would normally be.</li>

                    demonstrating Neville's growing expertise and love for the subject.</li>
                <li><strong>Defensive Mechanism:</strong>When touched, the plant's boils secrete Stinksap, a green,
                    foul-smelling liquid. The smell is often compared to rancid manure.</li>

                    -a complex potion that allows the drinker to take the form of another person. Knotgrass must be
